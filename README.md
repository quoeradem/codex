Codex
=====
The codex is content-driven [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) app designed to beautifully present a collection of markdown documents. Intended as a framework for app documentation, code references, or notes -- markdown syntax allows for inherent formatting of the content, while [Material Design](https://material.io/guidelines/) provides an elegant and uniform presentation.

**Note:**
This project is currently in alpha status. There are several planned updates leading up to a 1.0 release, at which point, documentation will be updated as well.

You can check out [this page](https://github.com/quoeradem/codex/projects/1) for a general roadmap of planned changes.
